# Unitary-Pulse-Generator
Generate a series of optimal unitary pulse amplitudes that will transform an initial Quantum state to a desired one over a series of timesteps, using the Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) algorithm by leveraging the QuTiP API.

# Instructions
1. Run ```pip install -r dependencies.txt``` to install required Python modules
2. Run ```pulse_generator.py``` in your Python interpreter to see the Magic!
