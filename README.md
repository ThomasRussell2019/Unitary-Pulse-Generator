# Unitary-Pulse-Generator
Generate a series of optimal unitary pulse amplitudes that will transform an initial Quantum state to a desired one over a series of timesteps, 
using the Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) algorithm by leveraging the QuTiP API.

#Instructions
Run ```pip install -r dependencies.txt``` to install required Python modules
Run ```pulse_generator.py``` in your Python interpreter to see the Magic!
